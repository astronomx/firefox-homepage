This project is a personalized homepage for firefox. I don't like the deafualt function of the homepage and it's not customizeable at 
all thats why I started this project. I took inspiration from pixelart what I personaly like and I wanted it to be relaxing and clean.

The icons are from **[Streamline HQ]('https://www.streamlinehq.com/icons/pixel')**
The font I used is Proggy Clean from **[NerdFonts]('https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads')**

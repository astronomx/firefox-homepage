# Firefox Homepage
This project is a personalized homepage for firefox. I don't like the deafualt function of the homepage and it's not customizeable at 
all thats why I started this project. I took inspiration from pixelart what I personaly like and I wanted it to be relaxing and clean.

## Functionalities
* The homepage has the basic functionalities for the bookmarks you can see in the cards. These route to the sites I mostly use and need.
The cards are split into three categories: **Programming**, **Work** and **Entertainment** for easier navigation.

* Besides these I added two function for the searchbar the first was to have your cursor in the searchbar when you open the page because there
was a problem due to the [extension]('https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/') I use that put that cursor in the URL bar automatically instead of the searchbar, and the second function I added
was to put your cursor in the search bar when you press CTRL + K. I know you are in the searchbar directly but when you are pressing around on the page
you might want to use the hotkey to get to the searchbar directly.

## Icons, fonts and more
The icons are from **[Streamline HQ]('https://www.streamlinehq.com/icons/pixel')**
<br />
The font I used is Proggy Clean from **[NerdFonts]('https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads')**

## Upcoming features
* Spotify integration
* Todo list

6. Press the **Keep Changes** button and you are done.
7. Enjoy your new homepageðŸ¥³
